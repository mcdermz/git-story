Once upon a time there was a dog.

It was a wonderful leetle dog and her name was Rosie. She loved her red chew toy because it reminded her of steaks.

Then a way more cuter more badass dog came along...jacked her chew toy then challenged her to a rap battle. She accepted in order to win her chew toy back. Here's how the rap battle started:

Yo biatch give me back my toy,
you think you're everything just because you're a boy,
but i'm a feminist didn't you know,
so move aside and don't mess with me so i loose my flow.

The new dog was so impressed by the rap that he gave Rosie back her toy and agreed to be her friend forever.

The End.
