Once upon a time there was a dog. yo yo

It was a wonderful leetle dog and her name was Rosie. She loved her red chew toy because it reminded her of steaks.

Then a way more cuter more badass dog came along...jacked her chew toy then challenged her to a rap battle. She accepted in order to win her chew toy back. Here's how the rap battle started:

Yo biatch give me back my toy,
you think you're everything just because you're a boy,
but i'm a feminist didn't you know,
so move aside and don't mess with me so i loose my flow.

The new dog was so impressed by the rap that he gave Rosie back her toy and agreed to be her friend forever.

But...

They formed a gang, rapped battled other gangs hard... and I mean hard.. to the point where American idle was like yo woof, we need more dog rappers. It's the new trend and all the rage these days. Kids love that shit so lets get you on board so we can sell merchandise.
